We arrived in Israel expecting ordinary days filled with conversation, shared meals, and a sense of history that always feels close to the surface there. Instead, the morning of October 7th unfolded with confusion and fear, as sirens cut through the air and phones filled with urgent messages. What we thought would be a short stay quickly turned into something far heavier and harder to process.

Within hours, it became clear that this was not a single incident but an ongoing attack. We moved between safe rooms and shelters, often with friends we had only recently met, bonded suddenly by necessity rather than time. Days blurred together as we stayed indoors, listening for updates, learning when it was safe to move, and trying to reassure one another while feeling anything but calm ourselves.

As the situation escalated, we were warned that civilians were being actively targeted, which changed the way we thought about every decision. Even short walks felt dangerous. Sleep came in fragments, interrupted by alarms, distant sounds, and the constant awareness that plans no longer mattered — only safety did.

When an opportunity arose to help at a local hospital, we went. The hospital was overwhelmed, yet remarkably organized, driven by people who had clearly done this before but never wanted to again. We assisted where we could, helping move children — both Palestinian and Israeli — into safer areas and temporary shelters, focusing less on identity and more on the simple fact that they were kids who needed protection.

The hospital corridors were filled with a quiet urgency. Doctors, nurses, volunteers, and families moved with purpose, speaking softly but acting quickly. Even in fear, there was humanity — shared water, reassuring words, small moments of kindness that felt almost defiant in the face of what was happening outside.

Eventually, when it was safe to leave, we carried the weight of those days with us. This experience reshaped how we think about travel, about adventure, and about what it means to show up when circumstances turn terrifying. This post isn’t about answers or conclusions — it’s simply a record of being there, of witnessing fear and courage exist side by side, during a moment none of us will ever forget.
