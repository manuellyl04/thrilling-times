excerpt: "I was leading a group of students in iguazu in a midterm trip when a friend of ours disappered. To be written."

I still remember this as one of the most stressful and saddest moments of my life. The kind where your stomach drops, your brain writes horror movies, and you’re convinced you’ve lost a friend forever. Luckily, for everyone involved, it ended well. Very well. Almost too well.

At the time, I was working as a travel monitor for a student organization, leading trips to Iguazú Falls, right at the border of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay. I had done this trip several times before. Plenty of chaos had already earned its place in the archives: an American who crossed into Brazil with a girl and woke up trapped behind immigration laws and a national park, full-blown panic attacks at sunrise, travelers fighting over nothing, and the occasional genius who decided to “just stay” without informing anyone. Standard operating procedure.

But nothing prepared me for this trip.

We traveled by bus, twenty long hours that, in your twenties, somehow feel like a rolling nightclub. There was laughter, jokes, drinks, and absolutely zero sleep. The return trip, of course, would be a silent coma. We arrived Friday night, had a casual dinner, visited the Triple Border, then Saturday was waterfalls by day and clubs by night. Sunday: more falls, birds, and sore legs. Monday morning, we’d head back.

This story unfolds on Saturday night.

With multiple buses full of thirsty, hungry students, we had deals with local clubs. As monitors, we got free drinks to distribute, usually for games and challenges. Dangerous power, in hindsight. One of my fellow monitors, a good friend of mine, took that responsibility a bit too seriously. He drank more than he should have, got kicked out of a club, and when I tried to help him, he waved me off.

“I’m fine,” he said confidently. “Go back inside. I’ll just go to the hotel.”

Famous last words.

The next morning, his bed was untouched.

We called him. Phone off.

At first, we tried to stay optimistic. Maybe he met someone. Maybe he crashed somewhere. Weird, yes, but he was a monitor. He would have told us. That’s when the unease started creeping in.

We went to the waterfalls with the rest of the group, calling the hotel every hour to ask if he’d returned. Nothing. By mid-morning, optimism was dead. We called the police. Missing person. Description given. Nothing. Hospital? Also nothing.

That was the worst part, the not knowing. It felt worse than bad news. My head went to dark places, and I barely remember the waterfalls that day.

We rushed back to the hotel and started searching ourselves. Police stations. Hospitals. No trace. Tears. Panic. Desperation.

Then the hotel called.

“He’s in prison.”

Prison.

We stood there, stunned, trying to process how someone goes from “I’m fine” to incarcerated overnight. We negotiated, begged, explained, and somehow managed to get him released that same afternoon. When we finally saw him, handcuffed, disheveled, very much alive, I hugged him like he’d returned from the dead.

The relief was overwhelming.

The story? He had tried to enter the wrong hotel, got into a fight with a security guard, and the police were called. And no, this wasn’t a movie. No phone call. No explanations. Just straight to jail.

Inside, he prepared for survival. He fashioned a weapon from a plastic fork. Just in case. They fed inmates from old paint buckets, something they affectionately called “the fat.” One of his cellmates? An elderly student who apparently had also made questionable life choices.

The best part?

After prison, he became the most popular guy in town. Girls swarmed him, asking what happened, completely captivated. The prison glow was real. Unstoppable. Legendary.

Years later, he ended up engaged to one of the girls from that very trip.

Turns out, the prison hype wasn’t in vain after all.

After that we had a custome party and he dressed as a prisioner, lol.
