In this story I went to Japan to celebrate my 30s birthday, I arrived to Tokio and was instantly shocked by Shibuya and Shinyuko. 
The amount of people, the cleanliness and cordialiality is what impressed me the most.

As it was my birthday I looked for fun things to do, and I landed in the Tokyo-Kyoto-Osaka loop, but because I had some extra time I decided
to try something different than sightseeing, eating and partying

I met someone in a train, another tourist who told me there is a pilgramige that people all over Japan go to do a couple hours from Kyoto and something
clicked. It was going to be three days, it was the pilgramige to the temples of Koyasan (please add info here)

The path is fulled with milestones, and messages, I barely met anyone and i think it was best that way. the messages carved in stone were
reminder of staying simple, control desires, be brave and appricative (include japonese quote that suits here)

When I arrived in town I was shaking, an enourmos happiness came from whitin me, I felt some peace that was diffrent than anything I expirience before,

As I was walking temples and reflecting, I found a trapped goat in some gates, no one was around and the animal was still.

I though that he might be so used to monks that it does fear me, and that was probably true, but I also noticed that he was completely trapped.

In Shinto, nature contains spirits and naturally I always wanted to be the GOAT greatest of all time, and I found this to be an Omen and a sidequest, saving the goat

I tried with sticks, and with all my strenght, but the bars woulnt move

I decided I needed help, but I dont speak japonese

I gathered some courage, looked for firefigher staying and wrote a message (picture with transalation of the message)

When I arrive to the firefighter statation there was noone there, just a phone on the wall. I tried calling and coulnt understand anything they told me

I wasnt going to give up on the goat, i saw a car coming and I asked them to stop pointing at the firestation

They went out and I showed them the message, they were able to communicate with the firegihters

The urgentcy of how the firefighters decended from a top floor and opened the garage for the trucks was impresive.

When they came down I showed them the message and a picture of the goat, the pointed at the fire truck, I made a sign of yes, and we parted

With the help of ropes and metal bar, we bended the gates and realised the goat, before it left, it looked at me and I felt something, like I made

friends with a new being

To end, funny enough I went to China a few days later, and in the strets of Shanghai I saw another goat, I looked at it and I felt a reverance when it look back at message
