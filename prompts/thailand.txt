When I was 19 I travelled abroad to volunteer for an NGO called AIESEC in Peru, and met a lot of travellers that were travelling fulltime in gap years, while volunterring and working

This trip changed my life as it was the first time I was fully independent, and felt free to do whatever I wanted

In the trip I met Irish guy in his 20s that told me that I should travel the south-east Asia in my 20s and that will be an expierience I will never forget

Then my parent gifted me a plane ticket as my 20s year old birthday, and I saved all year for it. I had about 4000USD and I was going to travel for 3 months, seems crazy
right now that I am older and I pay for restaurant and nicer hotels. But at that moment I only wanted Hostels and Street food and so I i got.

Ko-Sang Road in Thailand, that start of many adventures and mine. I had watched the movie 'The Beach' with Leo DiCaprio and remembered the words.

'Never refuse an invitation, never fail to be polite, and if it hurts, is probably worth it.

I met another traveller in Bangkok that invented me Ko-Tao in south Thailand so we could do a diving course together. Mind you that traveller minutes before
had swallowed a bug as a drunk challenge for 10 euros lol

So I booked my trip, and I went.

When I arrived to Kho-Tao by ferry it was paridise itself, I got a motorboke rental to go and comeback to my clases in the port and found my accomdation.

The first day skuba diving was insane, we learned all the gestures, protocols and explored the ocean floor with visibility that I didnt know it was possible

Luck changed quickly, the next day it started raining, and it didn't stop for the next couple days. It was hard rain with huge drops, I didn't know what to expect but

I started getting worried when some stores started closing and the streets were turning to rivers.

I decided to return my motorbike early as I didn't want to drive in mud, that ended up being extremely smart as the rained continue.

That night it rain with no stop, a true tropical storm, scary and the hotel told us we had to evacuate.

I didn't know what that meant, but I packed everything and head out. I knew I had to reach the port in order to have any chance to continue my trip in Kho-Phangan

The water was everywhere, on the street often the water on my waist, i knew the direction I had to go. So with my backpack I changed there.

As I was walking I saw the motorbike I rented floating on the street, the front glass door of the store had broken because of the water pressure.

I keep charging but got stopped in a low point, the water stream was to strong for me to continue, the locals were screaming at me to hold on and I was able to hold a pillar

there screams were because they were afraid it would fall and hurt me

Someone threw a rope to me and I held it, I was able to make to another checkpoint with other people and locals

Then I saw my savior, a huge contruction caterpillar that was moving land to redirectoon the water. The guy made us a sign and I boarded it. The water was so strong only

that machine would made it.

After a few minutes he left me in a safe place and almost kissed the earth, except it was still mud.

That night I found a hostel close to the port and stayed there and made a new friend who happened to have a huge motorbike, this guy was sketchy and older than me

me but we had a good laugh.

I had my ferry in the morning, I went to sleep, and when I woke up it was hell again, the streets where rivers and I wasn't going to charge again.

It was 5am and I found my friend again, he told me take me to the port in the motorbike, that he wasnt going to let down a mate.

For the first time in my life I saw someone snorring cocaine, and he told me to get ready, I was scared, knew it was a bad idea, but didn't want to stay in the island another moment, i boarded

I lost my boot on the way, had to push the bike a couple times but I made it.

After a very bumpy ferry ride, I was in Kho-Phangan, ready for full-moon pary and to continue my adventure
