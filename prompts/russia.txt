I arrived to Russia in odd circusntance, it during the Covid, I was student with just enough Money to pass the holidays cheaply and make it back home, I was leaving in Belgium but I could only flight to the US from outside of EU becuause
of some restrictions and I had to stay 2 weeks ooutside of Europe. In Canada I made some friends from Russia and always dreamt about visiting, and most
of all I thisrsty for advanture and Russia stared me back like a cold beer after a run

Arriving to Russia was troublesome, I am from a small country and we needed no visa nor covid study but it was so uncommon they confirm that with staff
multiple times. They didnt speak english so I was translating everything with my phone.

They gave me a Russian name, they didn't understand my name and that my surname is Lorenzo y Losada. So they name Y Losada in Russian, I letter name. How cool is that?
The guys in the hostel busted laughting when they say it.

So Moscow, Impressive, Monumental, Huge, Moved, I went out and would fall in love every 5 minutes. I felt that I was in the right place for 2 weeks adventure.

My true advanture began when I tried to move inside Russia, I decided the best way to go from Moscow to Saint Petersburg was to take the overnight translating
Also I romantisized that writters as Dostevisky and Pushkin would have done the same and I was following their steps

All my credit cards got rejected trying to but the ticket online, so I gather courage and left to the station. From the many good things of
cordiality is not one of them

I made 40 mins with a message I had translated on my phone, and a lot hope, I sent a capture to a friend and she confirmed is alright. When it was
finally my turn I looked at the employee in the eye pointed at my message and smile.

I have no idea what happened then, somehow I was getting screamed and after a minute other people waiting their turn made me a sign to move. I had failed.
In the end, Russian friend bought the ticket for me and I paid her cash a few days later.

There where not many hostels so I booked a guest house, I was going to have a room in old soviet complex. Easier to Say than done.

On the way to the guest house as I am passing the Bridges and get marvalloused I say a woman approching me with an overcoat, she looked in her 40s
and was quite pretty. She asked me if I was tourist, I said yes and she moved to a corner of the bridge and signed me to come her way from put her back against me
My curioisity won and I approched her, when I closed to her she told me over here shoulder that she would show me something that I can only see in Russia

She open her overcoat and on her front she was holding a baby bear, i couldnt believe my eyes, she told me for 500 rubles I can pet and take pictures and for
more money she can take see more animals. Although super curious and advantures I had to say no, afriad of being kidnapped xD

I went to the address of my guesthouse, it only took me hours to find it

I'd call, nothing or someone screaming in Russian

I found this man in the middle of the complex patio, he was drinking vodka straight from the bottle and walking his dog. I translated a message to him with my problem and
he made a sight to followed him, perhaps my drunk angel knows the guest house I thought

He takes me into one of the building, a floor down and knock on a door. I was ready to run xD

Another drunk man appeared, I guessed he was the handyman of the complex. He poited at me, they talk, they scream, they pushed, the handyman slapped the
man helping me and when back in his door. I will add the vodka bottle didnt fall. After that I decide to drop this man and knock on the door of english insture a couple blocks away.
They called the number and got better instructions, a very kind boy came with me and helped me found my way.

When I came in there was a babushka waiting for me, who gave a big hug and a kiss, I was home I thought
She made me dinner, and we had the coolest conversation translated on my phone I could imagine, she told me about her years in the Soviet Union and I still remember her
as one of the kindest i ever met.
