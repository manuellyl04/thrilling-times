This I still remember as one of the most stressful saddest moments of my life, I tought I lost a friend but fortunetely the story eneded well.

I was working for an student organization as a travel monitor on a Trip to Iguazu falls in the border of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay

I did this trip a couple times before and some notable had happened but nothing like this

Some stories include, and american ending up with a girl and ending up on the Brazilian side of the falls with a visa, and a panic attack in the morning as he coulnt come back without crossing a national park

Some fights between travellers, or geniuses deciding not come back with us and not telling anyone

We go by bus, a long 20 hours ride that in your 20s with friends feel like not that bad as we joke, laugh, party all the way there. The way back usually is all sleep.

We arrive on a friday and do a small dinner and go to the triple border, saturday we expierience that waterfalls and party, sunday another day in the falls and some bird parks, and monday morning we head out.

This story unrevels on saturday, as we travel with multiple buses of drinks hungry students we made some deals with local clubs and disco

Usually the monitors get free drinks to spread around the travellers for challenges

A friend of mine, another monitor, started drinking more than he should, and got kicket out of the clubs, I tried to help and he

told me to stay, that he was fine, and that he will just go back to the hotel

The next morning he wasn't in his room

We called him and the phone was off

We thought he might have found someone on the way to the hostel, and perhaps stayed the night there, but it was very strange

since he was a monitor, and he should have told us

We departed to the waterfalls with other tourist, and we would call hourly to the hotel to see if he came back

By mid morning we decided to call the police and told we had someone missing and drescribed him

they said they had no idea, and we should call the hospital, in the hospital the all had no idea

I felt despareate, not knowing felt worse than knowing something bad happened

We got back to the hotel and we decided to look for him in the hospital ourselves, we went to to police and also nothing.

As we were touring in desparation and tears, they call us from the hotel and told us he is in prision, we couldnt belive it

We negoziated to get him out that afternoon, and the tears became tears of joy

When we say him handcuffed, I couldnt help to hug him, they realized him that day

funny enough after we freed him he became the most popular guy in town, girls would sworm him asking him what happened

it seems that on the way out of the club, he had a fight with another security of hotel as he mistaked his hotel

that guy called the police and they arrested him, and is not like the movies were you get a free phone call

He told stories about prision that are now funny, like he made a weapon with a plastic fork in case of trouble

They brough all the cellmates food in bucket of paint, which they called the 'fat' and it was an old student

overall, one of the most worrysome moments of my life, this guy funny enough ended engaged with one of the girls from the Trip

guess the prision hype wasnt in vain
